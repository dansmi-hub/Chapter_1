# Introduction
The burden and risk of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) is increasing across Europe, not only in urban areas, driven by invasive Aedes mosquitoes (e.g., Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika), but also in more rural or peri-urban areas, at the interfaces between human habitation, agriculture, and natural ecosystems such as wetlands where both native and invasive species pose threats to human health (e.g., WNV, Usutu, Sindbis, Rift Valley Fever). This increase in risk is broadly linked to several global challenges including land use change, climate change and increased globalisation [@kilpatrickGlobalizationLandUse2011 ]. Rapid urbanisation and anthropogenic land use change including increased agricultural intensification is increasing the available interface at which people and mosquitoes can interact and exposure to potential MBDs [@gottdenkerAnthropogenicLandUse2014; @meyersteigerMosquitoCommunitiesDisease2016; @townroeBritishContainerBreeding2014]. It is increasingly clear that MBD risk is closely associated with localised human use of ecosystems which can be linked to individualised exposure, @lambinPathogenicLandscapesInteractions2010 showed an increase in risk between human vocation, land use and the relative risk factors of Lyme disease and other hemorrhagic fevers, while @reinerSociallyStructuredHuman2014 illustrated the importance of socially driven movement in perpetuating Dengue transmission, particularly within modified ecosystems and habitat interfaces. In parallel there is an increased public and governmental policy in Europe on enriching biodiversity and managing natural habitats to maximise the provision of ecosystem services [@pehBenefitsCostsEcological2014; @defra25YearEnvironment2018]. Wetland habitats are frequently prioritised for management and restoration because of their high biodiversity, ability to act as refuges for endangered or threatened species and their utility in regulating hydrological processes [@gibbsWetlandLossBiodiversity2000; @keddyWetWonderfulWorld2009]. However, wetland ecosystems also provide habitats for invasive and native mosquito species, understanding how management or restoration of these habitats in relation to disease control is often overlooked, especially in areas where populations are historically naive to MBD because of its rapid geographical spread and recent risk increase [@medlockEffectClimateChange2015; @medlockReviewInvasiveMosquitoes2012]. 


## Examples of wetlands and mosquitoes
There is an urgent need to understand how these policy-driven changes in natural ecosystems may impact MBD risk, and how these changes can alter interactions with animal and human hosts, and therefore may trade off against valuable biodiversity, agricultural and economical ecosystem services [@daleWetlandsMosquitoesReview2008; @acremanTradeoffEcosystemServices2011]. A comprehensive review by @reyNorthAmericanWetlands2012 discusses the importance of wetland management in North America through decreasing suitability of breeding sites for mosquitoes and increasing biodiversity of predators, however these control methods can often be at odds with management plans [@russellConstructedWetlandsMosquitoes1999].  Similarly, in South Africa, the reduction of wetland water levels during mosquito breeding seasons leads to desiccation of mosquito larvae during development and can prove an adequate control method, but negatively impacts other aquatic flora and fauna of the wetland [@malanWetlandsInvertebrateDisease2009]. Wetland management decisions directly impact mosquito populations: increased nitrogen levels from fertiliser runoff increased pollution-resistant mosquito abundance ninefold in a constructed American wetland [@sanfordEffectsInorganicNitrogen2005]. Increased emergent vegetation and sediment build-up can lead to warmer waters and an increase in the density of culicine mosquito species and draining of water levels can reduce these numbers, but conversely make the habitat more suitable for _An. maculipennis_ a known nuisance biter [@medlockImpactsCreationExpansion2015]. Drought conditions arising from mismanagement of permanent wetlands can shift community compositions of mosquitoes from anopheline to culicine species and thus associated disease risk can increase or change depending upon vector status and localised disease prevalence in reservoir hosts [@chaseDroughtinducedMosquitoOutbreaks2003].

## UK Specifics - cover in this para
- Wetlands important in the UK
- Wetland management plans and strategies implemented by the GOV, Arms length bodies and NGOs
- More often than not the impact of mosquito disease is not considered in these plans
- Undeniably wetland restoration benefits almost certainly outweigh human disease risk in the UK given current levels of MBD being very low, but nothing to change that in the future and little consideration for future disease.
- Without knowing the impacts of wetland management techniques on mosquitoes we can't identify techniques that minimise mosquito disease risk while that are low friction for policy makers and don't impeded management goals.

Drivers for wetland creation in the UK are linked closely with overarching government strategy to achieve more sustainable farming initiatives, increase biodiversity and provisioning local and regional flood resilience programs [@defra25YearEnvironment2018; @defraCountrysideStewardshipHigher2023; @defraCountrysideStewardshipGet2023]. These strategies generally involve recreating, restoring and managing existing wetlands, for example payments to agricultural stakeholders to modify or maintain wetland environments and receive compensation for doing so. Significant wetland restoration has already taken place in the UK, with significant progress on restoring and maintaining large salt marsh wetlands and grassland wetlands in the UK  [@wwtPublications2023; @medlockImpactsCreationExpansion2015]. 

These projects are expected to improve natural habitats for rare species and improve local ecosystems considerably, but very few studies and reports consider how wetland creation and management may influence the risk of MBD apart from recent handbooks [@hawkesWetlandMosquitoSurvey2020]. Largely we consider this to be because MBD risk in the UK is currently extremely low and awareness of this with the last known case of endemic malaria in the UK dates back tot he early 20th century, however changing climates and spread of invasive mosquitoes mean MBD may become a credible endemic health problem for the UK in the future [@chinMalariaUKPresent2004; @medlockAssessmentPublicHealth2018]. It is undeniable that wetland restoration and creation will most likely have a net positive benefit on UK biodiversity, but the creation of wetlands can increase the abundance of mosquitoes, as well as lead to more direct contact between mosquito-borne disease reservoirs, such as waterfowl, and human populations, which use these areas for recreation [@daleWetlandsMosquitoesReview2008]. Failing to consider the impact of mosquito habitat creation could lead to unforeseen risks of MBD. 

Currently we understand relatively little about how wetland management strategies can impact mosquito abundance and community composition in Europe and particularly the UK and the resultant risk of disease transmission. In Spain wetland habitats were identified as important drivers of mosquito abundance and identified that large population centres close to wetland habitats is a priority for vector borne disease surveillance and control due to increased disease risk [@ferragutiEffectsLandscapeAnthropization2016]. @goldingIdentifyingBioticInteractions2015 found that predators of mosquitoes appeared to restrict mosquito prevalence at a wetland site in the UK and suggested that increasing habitat suitability for predators could increase biodiversity and reduce mosquito numbers.

Species distribution models have been applied at national, sub-national and local scales to study the impacts of wetland changes on individual mosquito vectors. However, community modelling approaches such as joint species distribution models [@goldingBayesCommBayesianCommunity2015; @ovaskainenJointSpeciesDistribution2020; @wilkinsonComparisonJointSpecies2019] may be more advantageous for identifying shared responses to environmental conditions [@poggiatoInterpretationsJointModeling2021] as management changes, and for accounting for biotic interactions such as competition and predation, that strongly influence mosquito population dynamics and persistence [@beketovPredationRiskPerception2007; @braksInterspecificCompetitionTwo2004; @sahaPredationPotentialOdonates2012] and will likely modulate individual vector species responses to wetland changes [@reyNorthAmericanWetlands2012].Â   

This study generates mosquito abundance data and applies community joint modelling methods to sampled larval and adult mosquito populations in the UK's largest wetland grassland, which is subject to long term manamgent under extensive agri-environmental schemes. Here we investigate the impact of implemented agri-environmental measures on mosquito community abundance and composition, where water level, grazing pressure and human intervention are differentially managed across a UK [TABLEREF]. We want to understand the role of abiotic (water chemistry, channel morphology) and biotic factors (vegetation structure, predator communities) in determining larval mosquito community composition. Additionally, we want to  determine whether wetland management strategies under recent agri-environmental schemes are likely to have increased the larval abundance and diversity of key UK mosquitoes with known vector status, and determine what habitat management techniques are likely to influence community composition fo these vectors [TABLE].  In areas where management strategies encourage an increase in water levels, we expect to see a higher density of mosquitoes commonly associated with permanent wetland habitats, particularly those that overwinter such as _An. claviger_. In more extensively managed areas we would expect to find the opposite, with the structural complexity of the habitat to be more appropriate for species such as An. maculipennis known to have an affinity to warmer, open habitats [@hawkesWetlandMosquitoSurvey2020].
